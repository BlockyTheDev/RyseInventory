## Welcome to RyseInventory

I'm glad you seem to be interested in contributing to RyseInventory.

You have your own ideas or have fixed bugs on your own in RyseInventory? First of all thanks for the effort. But before you want to contribute, consider the following points:
1. The term "Java Conventions" means something to me
2. I stick to the Java conventions
3. I am familiar with Java

## Bugs, ideas or questions?
No problem at all. Please try to put your mistake, idea or question concretely according to the situation. This will ensure that your time and that of other people is not wasted.

If you would like to contribute ideas that you can't implement yourself, I would be very happy if you would create the idea under Issues. If this idea is good, someone will take care of it and implement it. This ensures that RyseInventory keeps growing and not only developer ideas are implemented but also player ideas.

## Pull Request
You have already implemented your idea? Very good! The next step is to create only one pull request. By doing so, you allow me to implement your idea in RyseInventory and make it available to everyone.

But before you just send a pull request, I ask you not to send an empty pull request. Why?
* Imagine it's a big idea you've implemented. (We assume that you had to change over 1,000 lines for it). This is time consuming to check, so try to make it easy for me, and follow this [template](https://github.com/Rysefoxx/RyseInventory/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md). This way I have a first impression and know what you implemented.

Please note that if you create a PR, it may be rejected. Often the reasons are as follows:
* Some PR without any description of what it does exactly.
* It contains errors
  * Compile Error
  * Java Convention
* Continuously repeating code not outsourced. Example:

Last but not least, should you push your changes to your repo, be sure to include clear and understandable commit text. A text like "couple of changes made" will not do anything.
