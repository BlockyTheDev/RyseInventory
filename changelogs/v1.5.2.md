* You no longer need to pass the InventoryManager in the Manager. It is enough to initialize & invoke the InventoryManager as a field in the main class.
* If you do not specify a start slot in the SlotIterator, a concrete error will now be thrown.
* Fixed a bug where the InventoryClickEvent didn't find the item.
