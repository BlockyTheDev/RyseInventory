* There is now the #enableAction method to enable possible inventory actions.
* Now there are the following methods:
  * InventoryContents#getDataFromCurrentPage() -> Get all data from the current open page.
  * InventoryContents#getDataFromPage(page) -> Get all data from a given page.
  * InventoryContents#getAllData() -> Get all data from all pages.
* In this regard, the #getAll method is now deprecated. 
* The serialize method in the RyseInventory class should now serialize all values.
* There is now the #ignoreManualItems method. This method can be used to prevent the items that the player puts in the inventory from being saved.
* From the default, all items that the player puts in the inventory or removes are now saved. (Beta! Errors could occur)
