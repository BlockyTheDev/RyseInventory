* The following animations can also now be ended during the loop:
  * IntelligentItemLoreAnimator
  * IntelligentItemNameAnimator
  * IntelligentMaterialAnimator

* Each page size can now be set individually. Use the #rows(Page) method in the builder.
* Fixed a bug where a right-click threw an NPE.
* The #enableActions method is no longer in beta, as no other bugs related to this method have been reported.
* Fixed a bug that allowed items to be shifted into the inventory even though it shouldn't work.
* The #ignoredSlots and #enableAction methods have received another parameter. Namely a BooleanSupplier, if this returns true, the method will be executed.
