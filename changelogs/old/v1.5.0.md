* Fixed an error where the algorithm created another page that did not physically exist.
* Pattern code was rewritten and in this regard there is now the method:
  * #define(String, Integer) This can be used to prevent repeated patterns such as XXXXOXXXX, XXXXOXXXX, XXXXOXXXX. Instead you can say #define("XXXXOXXXX", 6). This pattern will now be applied 6x.
