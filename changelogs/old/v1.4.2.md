* There is now a method InventoryContents#fillArea to fill items in an area.
* There is now in the RyseInventory Builder the method ignoreEvents to disable events as desired.
* In the InventoryProvider there is now the method onClose, which is called before the inventory is completely closed. Thanks to @Booquefius
